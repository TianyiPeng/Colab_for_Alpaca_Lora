# Colab for Alpaca LoRA
If you're looking to fine-tune a ChatGPT-level model but lack access to a GPU, Google Colab may be a useful solution to consider.

With a Google Colab Pro account, you can access a single 40GB A100 GPU ($10 for approximately 7.5 hours) or Tesla T4 GPU ($10 for approximately 50 hours), and sometimes these resources are available for free.

Here is a Google Colab Notebook Example for fine-tuning Alpaca Lora (within 2-3 hours with a single 40GB A100 GPU). In particular, [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) is a fine-tuning version of Meta LLaMA (a large lanuage model with tens of billions parameters) based on a small instruction set. [Alpaca LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) used [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf) to optimize the speed and resource required for reproducing Alpaca.

This notebook just serves as an example. Check [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) and [Alpaca LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) for more usage instructions.
